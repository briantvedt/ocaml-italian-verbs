# ocaml-italian-verbs

*Incomplete and obsolete. Doing this in SML instead.*

An OCaml library for conjugating Italian verbs.

The goal is to derive all the inflected forms of a given verb from a limited
set of rules, rather than referring to a large database.

The code should be as readable as possible, with the hope that the rules can be
fully grasped by a human language learner.

# Limitations

This project is in its earliest stage, and currently only regular verbs,
and only some of their tenses, are supported.

# Running
